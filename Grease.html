                <h2>REPURPOSING WASTE: GREASE SYNTHESIS FROM USED ENGINE OIL</h2>

                <p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The proper disposal of used engine oil remains a pressing environmental concern, with improper handling often leading to detrimental soil pollution.</li>
                    <li>Our project was to investigate possibilities of processing this waste material into a valuable resource through the scientific process of grease synthesis.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Experiment Design:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>As a part of project we counducted three experiments, each consisting the synthesis of grease through distinct combinations of reactants.</li>
                    <li>Experiment 1 involved the utilization of NaOH and lube oil, while Experiment 2 employs Ca(OH)₂ and lube oil.</li>
                    <li>Experiment 3 involved the production of grease from used engine oil using NaOH.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Reactive Properties and Grease Formulation:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The cornerstone of grease production lies in the chemical process of saponification, wherein metal hydroxides interact with the triglycerides present in oils.</li>
                    <li>When Ca(OH)₂ reacts with oil, the following saponification reaction occurs:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ca(OH)₂ + 3 RCOOCH₃ → Ca(RCOO)₂ + 2 CH₃OH</li>
                        </ul>
						When calcium hydroxide interacts with the triglycerides present in the oil, saponification process occurs. Triglycerides, the primary constituents of oils, comprise three fatty acid chains esterified to a glycerol. Upon exposure to calcium hydroxide, the hydroxide ions (OH⁻) initiate a nucleophilic attack on the ester linkage of the triglycerides, leading to their hydrolysis. As a result, the fatty acid chains are liberated, forming calcium salts of fatty acids (calcium soap) and methanol as a byproduct. The formation of calcium soap renders the grease its characteristic thick and viscous consistency, making it suitable for various industrial applications.                    </li>
                    <li>Similarly, the reaction of NaOH with oil leads to the formation of sodium soap (grease) and methanol:
                        <ul>
                            <li>3 NaOH + RCOOCH₃ → 3 NaRCOO + CH₃OH</li>
                        </ul>
                        Analogous to the reaction with calcium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide catalyzes the hydrolysis of triglycerides present in the oil. The hydroxide ions in sodium hydroxide act as nucleophiles, attacking the ester linkage of the triglycerides to cleave them into their constituent fatty acid chains and glycerol. Consequently, sodium salts of fatty acids (sodium soap), commonly known as grease, are formed along with methanol as a byproduct. Sodium soap exhibits similar thickening properties to calcium soap, albeit with slightly different characteristics, making it suitable for a range of applications in lubrication and mechanical engineering.

                <p><strong>Results and Limitations:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our experiments successfully yielded grease from used engine oil, demonstrating the feasibility of repurposing this waste material into a functional resource.</li>
                    <li>However, due to time and resource constraints, detailed analyses of the grease properties, such as dropping point, endurance, temperature stability, and viscosity, were not conducted.</li>
                    <li>Future research could be conducted into these aspects to ascertain the practical utility of the synthesized grease.</li>
