									<h3>MSc Thesis: Improving the Sustainability of Large Infrastructure<br> using Passive Cooling Techniques.</h3>
								</header>
								<p>My research for the MSc was focused on identification of Phase Change Materials (PCM) and heat exchange techniques for passive cooling applications. The aim was to devise a technique to 
									reduce the cooling load on a heat pump system used for cooling transmission electron microscopes. Part of research was to come up with a design of heat exchanger and PCM arrangement that can be implemented first at pilot scale.
									<p><h3>Challenges:</h3> <li> Identification of PCM which could function within a very thin temperature margin (17°C to 23°C).</li>
									<li>Selection of an effective heat exchange option with less space consumption. </li><li>Heat exchange simulations (turbulent flow) across pipe crossections to identify the effectivity of the implementation of the system.</li>
									<li>Identification of the possible Carbon savings using extrapolation.</li>

									</p>
									
									<h3>Results</h3>Designed a pilot system incorporating a radiator and PCM aided by finned tube heat exchange that can save up to 47 KWh and 14 kg CO2 per day.
									Provided calculations and therotical justification to the idea of utilizing the system can actually reduce the overall load on the heat pump signigicantly. Estimated the PCM charging and discharging cycle based on energy transfer and, potential CO2 and KWh Savings which included the analysis of energy consumption of the existing system. Built an Ansys fluent simulation model for heat transfer analysis.

								<p> Research work in artificial lift systems used to pump oil from the well bores with depleted pressure or insufficient pressure to overcome the liquid head. My project included calculations, analysis for the best possible lift technique and a short comparison of the diffrent artificial lift techniques.</p>
								<h3>Challenges:</h3>
								<li>Filtration and analysis of historic production data. </li>
								<li> Detection of the best artificial lift technique that can be utilised considering the existing pressure, temperture and physical conditions.</li>
							
                                <p><h3>Results:</h3>Calculated design properties and pump characteristics for an ESP production system for a vertical oil well.
                                    acquired skills in data filtration, Pump head, and flow calculations.
                                    Calculated the multiphase flow rates of the well fluids using 'PROSPER', a simulation software.</p>

									<h3>Project Intern: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Mumbai</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Summer research internship at the India's crown Petroleum Organization, ONGC. Research work was on natural gas hydrate formation in gas pipelines.
									As a part, I Engineered solutions to mitigate hydrate formation in a high-pressure gas pipeline using chemical methods.
									Simulated gas hydrate formation using simulation software 'PIPESIM' to study the hydrate behavior. One of the focus point of research was to study the Gas dehydration techniques used at ONGC.
								The aim of this research was to extract a hydrate mitigation technique for an ongoing ONGC pipeline project at Assam, India as a part of pre design analysis.</p>
