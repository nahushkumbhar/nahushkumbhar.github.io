									<h3>MSc Thesis: Improving the Sustainability of Large Infrastructure<br> using Passive Cooling Techniques.</h3>
								</header>
								<p>My research for the MSc was focused on utilization of Phase Change Materials (PCM) and heat exchange techniques for passive cooling applications. The aim was to devise a technique to 
									reduce the cooling load on heat pump system used for cooling transmission electron microscopes. Objective of the research was to come up with a theoritical design of a pilot system integrating a heat exchanger and PCM that can be implemented to reduce fraction of the cooling load. Further perform analysis and simulation to check the feasibility of deploying a full scale system.
									<p><h3>Challenges:</h3> <li> Identification of PCM which could function within a very thin temperature margin (17°C to 23°C).</li>
									<li>Selection of an effective heat exchange option with less space consumption. </li><li>Heat exchange simulations (turbulent flow) across pipe crossections to identify the effectivity of the implementation of the system.</li>
									<li>Identification of the possible Carbon savings using extrapolation.</li>

									</p>
									
									<h3>Results</h3>Designed a pilot system incorporating a radiator and PCM aided by finned tube heat exchange that can save up to 47 KWh and 14 kg CO2 per day.
									Provided calculations and therotical justification to the idea of utilizing the system can actually reduce the overall load on the heat pump signigicantly. Estimated the PCM charging and discharging cycle based on energy transfer and, potential CO2 and KWh Savings which included the analysis of energy consumption of the existing system. Built an Ansys fluent simulation model for heat transfer analysis.

								<p> Research work in artificial lift systems used to pump oil from the well bores with depleted pressure or insufficient pressure to overcome the liquid head. My project included pump specific calculations, analysis for the best possible artificial lift technique and a short comparison of the diffrent artificial lift techniques. <a href="ESP.html"> Learn more.</a></p>
								<h3>Challenges:</h3>
								<li>Filtration and analysis of historic production data. </li>
								<li> Detection of the best artificial lift technique that can be utilised considering the existing pressure, temperture and physical conditions.</li>
							
                                <p><h3>Results:</h3>Calculated multistage centrifugal pump (ESP) properties to align with the prespecified oil production rate (flowrate) for a vertical oil well.
                                    Acquired skills in data filtration, flow calculations and modelling pump calcs on MS Excel.
                                    Calculated the multiphase flow rates of the well fluids using 'PROSPER', a simulation software.</p>

								<p>This was a semester project. As a part of this project, I conducted an evaluation of the oil reservoir properties and well performance using history match technique on MS Excel and 'ECRIN' software.
									Aim of the analysis was to study the behavior of the Pressure transient and identify the well bore properties using PTA.
								 Calculated permeability, skin factor, completion eff, reservoir boundary and OIP and STOIP. <a href="Oil Production.html"> Learn more.</a></p>

								<p>Project was focused on calculation of key parameters for a 2-phase vertical separator from a case study problem statement. Calculated effective internal diameter (d), liquid capacity, residance time, slenderness ratio required for separator screening, considering specific gravity (SG), flow rates, and API gravity of the fluids. Key take aways were clear understanding of O&G separation operations and types of separators available in the industry. </p>

									<h3>Project Intern: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Mumbai</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Summer research internship at the India's crown Petroleum Organization, ONGC. Research work was on natural gas hydrate formation in gas pipelines.
									The aim of this research was to support senior engineers to extract a economically viable hydrate prevention technique for an ongoing ONGC project at Assam, India. As a part, I studied and documented a comparison of the industrial solutions employed to prevent hydrate formation in high-pressure gas pipelines using chemical methods.
									Another motivation of research was to study the Gas dehydration techniques and systems utilized at ONGC GPF (Gas Processing Facility). This experience was a huge learning activity and corporate exposure.
