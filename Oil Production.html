										<p>In the current world where decarbonisation is getting popular due to existing global warming and future pollution threats, oil and gas still holds a prominent position as a fuel. Oil or black gold as commonly referred in geopolitics, plays a crucial role in world economy, energy and daily life of people whether directly or indirectly. This article delves into the exploration and production (E&P) science behind oil and natural gas.</p>
										<p>The E&P as referred in the industry involves various segments from oil exploration to processing and final production of petrochemicals. The production process of oil can be divided as: Exploration: Geophysics (study of oil in place in subsurface), Reservoir engineering (study of subsurface geology and oil properties), Drilling (drilling well for oil extraction), Production (extraction of oil and gas to surface) and Processing (separation of Oil and gas, processing into petrochemicals like Diesel, Petrol, Natural gas). These individual segments involve huge internal engineering and studies. We will be covering each of these segments in brief in this blog ahead.</p>

											<h2>Casing and Cementation</h2>
											<P>Once the oil well is drilled, the well is cemented and cased to be ready for oil production. A typical oil well runs deep into subsurface and may have features like deviations, and geoligical challenges like loose formations, permeable formations containing water, other minerals which may damage the lone borehole. To protect and keep the borehole intact and isolated from the subsurface environment, the borehole is cased. The figure below depicts a typical casing scheme. The surface casing runs in shallow depths and has largest diameter compared to other casings, and its purpose is to seal off the borehole from water/ mineral formations a shallower depths. The intermediate casing usually runs longest in the well lenght at deeper lengths as shown in the figure. While the production casing is the deepest which protects the profuction tube from which the oil ang gas is produced. </P>
											<P>Once the casings are placed, the well is perforated at the bottom hole to create rupture and allow the oil to flow into the well and run through the production tube up till the surface. Advanced techniques like hydraullic facturing or acid treatments (also termed as Well Stimulation) are implemented in cases where the permeability or geological characteristics need to be enhanced in order to increase the fluid flow to the well bore. These stimulation techniques are common in shale formations or in Gas producing wells having shale rock reservoir. </P>
