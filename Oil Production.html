									<div>
								

										<p>In the current world where decarbonisation is getting popular due to existing global warming and future pollution threats, oil and gas still holds a prominent position as a fuel. Oil or black gold as commonly referred in geopolitics, plays a crucial role in world economy, energy and daily life of people whether directly or indirectly. This article delves into the exploration and production (E&P) science behind oil and natural gas.</p>
										<p>The E&P as referred in the industry involves various segments from oil exploration to processing and final production of petrochemicals. The production process of oil can be divided as: Exploration: Geophysics (study of oil in place in subsurface), Reservoir engineering (study of subsurface geology and oil properties), Drilling (drilling well for oil extraction), Production (extraction of oil and gas to surface) and Processing (separation of Oil and gas, processing into petrochemicals like Diesel, Petrol, Natural gas). These individual segments involve huge internal engineering and studies. We will be covering each of these segments in brief in this blog ahead.</p>
